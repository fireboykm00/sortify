## üß† **Project Overview: Smart File Organizer**

### üîß **Problem It Solves**

Many professionals and teams deal with **cluttered download folders** or **shared drives** full of random files. Manually organizing files by type, date, or project takes time, leads to errors, and makes collaboration harder.

This app:

- Automatically **sorts files** into folders (e.g., PDFs, images, docs)
- Optionally organizes by **modification date** or **custom rules**
- Provides a **clear visual interface** for users to drop/upload files and preview results

| Layer       | Tech Used                     | Purpose                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend    | **Nuxt.js** (or Nuxt UI Pro)  | Upload UI, show folder structure before/after |
| Backend     | **Python (FastAPI or Flask)** | File logic, folder structure, API             |
| File System | `os`, `shutil`, `pathlib`     | Organizing files based on rules               |

## üñºÔ∏è **User Flow**

1. **User opens web app**

   - Sees a drag-and-drop UI to upload files or select a folder

2. **User clicks ‚ÄúOrganize‚Äù**

   - Picks a method: _by file type_, _by modified date_, or _custom rules_

3. **Backend organizes files**

   - Moves files into folders like `/Images`, `/PDFs`, `/2024-05/`, etc.

4. **User sees new structure**

   - UI displays old structure vs. new folder structure tree

## üß© **Key Features You Can Build in 4 Hours**

### 1. **Frontend (Nuxt.js)**

- File drop zone using `<input type="file" multiple>`
- Options for:

  - Group by file type
  - Group by date

- Call Python API on button click
- Preview tree structure (you can generate and display this as a JSON or text tree)

### 2. **Backend (Python)**

- Receive uploaded files via REST endpoint
- Use `os` and `shutil` to:

  - Group files into subfolders
  - Rename duplicates
  - Return a summary of new structure

- Optionally zip the organized folder for download

## ‚úÖ **Why It‚Äôs Impressive**

- **Practical utility**: Everyone has messy folders ‚Äî this solves a universal issue.
- **Automation**: Shows your ability to write scripts that save time and reduce errors.
- **Front + back integration**: Demonstrates full-stack ability and API design.
- **Expandable**: Could grow into a desktop app, CLI, or cloud integration.

## üöÄ Extra Ideas (If You Have Time)

- Use `tree`-style visualization in Nuxt
- Add ‚ÄúUndo‚Äù button to revert changes
- Save user presets (e.g., always group by file type)
- Add Google Drive / Dropbox integration later
